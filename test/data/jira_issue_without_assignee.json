We are a small company with most employees located in California, but we have employees all over the U.S.  We just moved our JIRA server to a data center located out of the timezone.  I assumed that I'd be able to configure the timezone since I can do that today in Confluence.  I was surprised that I couldn't configure the timezone and was disappointed to see this feature request open for almost 3 1/2 years.\r\n\r\nAtlassian, I love you guys.  I love JIRA and Confluence, but I find myself frustrated at the differences between JIRA and Conflence.  It's very frustrating to see a feature available in one product, but not the other.  It leaves a strong impression that you treat the two products almost as if they were run by separate companies.  Please, please strive to get more consistency between the two products and please, please implement this feature.",

In this scenario the pure server time is \"unusable\" for nearly all JIRA users (relatively few people live in a GMT timezone).  For instance, we're on Eastern Time in the U.S., but the JIRA time is always GMT.  :-(\r\n\r\nSo, please fix this soon since it makes tracking down times and dates usable in JIRA for us.",

I noticed that one of my colleagues had logged an issue at 3:37am, which I am sure she didn't and a bit of digging around revealed that this was a different timezone.\r\n\r\nWe're using an Enterprise Edition of JIRA with projects running across different continents and this feature is an absolute must in order to help us correctly synchronise and track issues.",

We have a lot (thousands) of feature and improvement requests and our main challenge is to select which features to add next.\r\n\r\nWe woud like to do this feature carefully as users can exist in various time zaones and every time a date is entered (due date, date and date/time custom fields) we need to ensure we do not store the wrong date.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, at the moment this feature is not scheduled for a particular release, and therefore I am unable to provide a date for its implementation. I am sorry for not being able to help more at this time.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAnton\r\n",

Some of the popular requested features included in the last few releases are:\r\n* editable comments\r\n* convert issues to sub tasks and vice versa\r\n* added start dates and the ability to edit and delete worklogs\r\n* aggregate time tracking information across sub tasks\r\n\r\nWe would prefer to leave this issue open as we are planning to look at it in the future. However, as I have mentioned in my previous comment, we do not have the date for its implementation.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAnton",

So it makes crystal clear that you cannot rely on the database to manange timezones and raises this issue criticity. \r\nThe best would be to store all the dates GMT and then to change the timzone only when the date is displayed according to the user settings, Java can handle this easily.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJean-Baptiste",

I thought Atlassians motto was DFTC? ;) Maybe this issue was logged before that came about? ;)\r\n\r\nAs a technical suggestion, grab the timezone from javascript and do the conversions in the UI, keep the database on a standard timezone -- that's what I've done to handle this problem before. You can get tricky and allow a user profile override too but that has problems if people jump between timezones. At least as a first step so you dont have to go crazy figuring out how to support N database timestamp schemes.\r\n\r\n+1 from Jira Enterprise customer (if that helps get it short_er listed)",

Though this is a minor feature, it's like a spelling mistake on a menu. You can't believe it hasn't been noticed and fixed. Every day it eats away a little bit at your satisfaction with the product. JIRA has lots of great features and it does a lot for us, but when this does get fixed I won't be saying \"what a cool feature\". I'll be saying \"I can't believe how long it took for them to get around to this.\"\r\n\r\nThanks for the opportunity to comment and for the courage to put your product planning out in public.\r\n",

They can dynamically select the timezone, then everything they see is displayed in their selected timezone.  Schedules, etc are saved with timezone information stored (ie. it knows what timezone the user was in when they created a schedule).\r\nIt's not trivial, but it's certainly not a massive task.",

So now, depending on where you look in Jira, you get different times for the dates - even on the same screen! (the view issue screen showing server timezone with the activity stream showing client timezone at the bottom).  This is very confusing, esp. to new users.  I'd raise it as a bug, but I fear that would take a step backwards, instead of the original limitation being fixed.  So we'll just live with it for now.",

                    "body": "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nJust a quick note to let you know that a JIRA developer has created a small plugin named MyZone that has limited timezone support.\r\n\r\nThe MyZone plugin will give each user the option of setting their timezone location via their user profile. It will then show converted dates and times on the view issue page. In the example screenshot below you can see converted dates and times as underlined while the mouse hover shows the JIRA server time (relative dates e.g.Today 2:30pm are also converted): \r\n\r\n!times.png!\r\n\r\nPlease note that the plugin will not convert times in the issue navigator nor when entering dates/times in issues, it only currently works on the view issue display. \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in testing MyZone you can [download|https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/29054?versionId=29055] the plugin from the Atlassian Plugin Exchange. Please note that it is not an Atlassian supported plugin but the developer is keen to hear your thoughts and feedback. So we ask that you send all issues and feedback directly to the developer via the [plugin site directly|http://github.com/luuuis/jira-myzone/issues]. (You will need to sign up for a free account)\r\n\r\nHappy testing!\r\n\r\nRoy Krishna\r\nJIRA Product Management",

We are not suggesting that this is a complete solution to this issue, but rather a simple plugin that a developer has created to address the view issue page. It was done in his spare time as he wanted a simple solution to view times on the issue screen. Again, let me confirm with you that this is not the Atlassian supported solution. We will be looking at this down the track. Sorry that I was not more clear on this point earlier.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to email me directly on this matter.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRoy Krishna\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nroy at atlassian dot com\r\n\r\n",
